## UI Issues

### Give Feedback Button Positioning and Styling
- **Status**: Open
- **Priority**: Low
- **Description**: The "Give Feedback" button is currently overlaying the proceed buttons, causing a UI conflict.
- **Required Changes**:
  1. Move the feedback button upwards so it doesn't overlay/conflict with the proceed buttons
  2. Change the button color to better distinguish it from other UI elements
